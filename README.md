# Design and Implementation of Software Falut Location Tool Based on Coverage Information


>This paper evaluates 2 families of fault localization techniques: 
spectrum-based fault localization (SBFL techniques for short) which is the most studied and evaluated FL technique; 
and mutation-based fault localization (MBFL techniques for short).


## Techniques
* SBFL
    * Ochiai
    * Dstar
* SMFL
    * Metallaxis
* Gzoltar
* The Major mutation framework
* Defects4j

>Fault-localization-data repository (https://bitbucket.org/rjust/fault-localization-data)
>the Defects4J database of real faults (https://github.com/rjust/defects4j), 
>the GZoltar fault localization tool (http://www.gzoltar.com/), 
>the Major mutation framework (http://mutation-testing.org/).
