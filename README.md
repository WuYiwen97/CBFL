Design and Implementation of Software Falut Location Tool Based on Coverage Information


>This paper evaluates 2 families of fault localization techniques: 
spectrum-based fault localization (SBFL techniques for short) which is the most studied and evaluated FL technique; 
and mutation-based fault localization (MBFL techniques for short).
